# Note Taker üìù
Welcome to note taker! Your virtual note taker in the command line. I coded this with Python using the following dependencies:
- [Peewee](https://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/)
- [Psycopg2](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/)
- [Autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/)

I'm also using SQL as the database which is storing all the notes created!

You can create new notes, update your note, view all notes, and delete your notes right within the command line.

## How to Use:

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Install the dependencies using the below command:
```
pipenv install
```
3. Make sure you are working in the shell enviroment by running the below command:
```
pipenv shell
```
4. Once inside the shell envirnment run the below command to start the Note Taker app:
```
python3 main.py
```
5. Happy coding!
